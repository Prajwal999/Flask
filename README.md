### Another Basic Todo list (This is an updated version of the Todo List that I was learning from a YouTube tutorial)

- This is my simple Todo List, made entirely with the FreeCodeCamp tutorial, with more stuff added by me for learning purposes. This project is for learning purposes only. I will try to add more things, more of my things, using this code as a template. 
- If Anybody wants to see the tutorial, here is the link: [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/Z1RJmh_OqeA?si=G7r8tbGQispFPk9z)
- Here is the developer's GitHub: [https://github.com/jakerieger/FlaskIntroduction]
